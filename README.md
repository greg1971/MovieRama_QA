Webdriver java implementation for automatically testing all features of the MovieRama web application

Some of the projectÂ´s features are:

1. Usage of the Selenium Webdriver Interface wrapped by Junit 4 and in this project implemented by FirefoxDriver class. In a similar way, the automated tests can be further modified to be implemented by InternetExplorerDriver, OperaDriver, SafariDriver and hence be xecuted with Internet Explorere Opera and Safari respectively
2. Location of the various WebElements, via absolute and relative XPath expressions
3. Dynamic processing of the web elements after storing then in java.util.List <Webelement> objects for manipulating the on the fly, later on
4. Foreward and backwards navigation through all the retrieved web pages
5. Exception Handling
6. Performance test of the HTTP responses, which should be retrieved in no more than 3 seconds
7. Positive and negative testing scenarios

<b>Note</b>: Test plan describing the logic that is implemented in the webdriver scripts can be found in PDF format under **_"Resources"_** folder.
